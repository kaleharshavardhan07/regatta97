                <h2>About Regatta</h2>
                <p>Regatta is an annual boat festival organized by the
                    students of the COEP Technological University, Pune. The
                    festival, which has a history of 97 years, is a major attraction
                    for the people of Pune and every year draws a colossal and
                    immense amount of crowd. The word "Regatta" signifies a
                    series of boat races. Every year, the Regatta features more
                    than 165 distinctive boats. It reaches new levels of creativity
                    and talent. Since 1928, the Regatta has been a prestigious
                    COEP tradition. It is the stunning result of diligent practice,
                    astute brains, devotion, and fervent determination. The
                    COEP Regatta is a magnificent competition that showcases
                    the tenacity and talent of the students who train day and
                    night to dazzle a crowd of over 12000 spectators with their
                    astounding diversity of boats. Now looking forward we are
                    all set to host our 96th edition with a lot of enthusiasm.

                <h1>Our Legacy</h1>
                <p>
                    <span>R</span>egatta generally means races of boats. With these races, during the
          year of 1928, COEP laid the foundation for today's prodigious Regatta. By giving a shot to Punt Formation,
          numerous innovative brains of COEP and its faculty kept the legacy of races undaunted and resilient. Further
          with variety of boats, multiple events stunned the audience. 97 years old legacy stood worth, giving
          recognition as the <em>"Oldest College Fest of India"</em> by Limca Book of Records.Boating is a sport that develops sportsmanship, strength, confidence and co-ordination.
          Students connect to this sport by participation and by being an audience of Regatta. COEP motivates students
          participation in competitions held at district, state and national level. Rowers and Kayakers of our college
          with determination, focus and hard work achieved laurels and victories with flying colors.

                <h1>Our previous edition</h1>
                <p>The Regatta presents a marvelous chance for students to discover and explore water sports such as rowing, kayaking, and canoeing, potentially igniting a professional pursuit. It goes beyond being a mere competition, encompassing a broader spectrum of experiences and opportunities. 96th Regatta was held on 24th March 2024 and was a challenging event for everyone. Despite the numerous challenges, students pursued their goals and determination to participate in Regatta.Days and nights were dedicated to meticulous planning for this grand fest. What sets Regatta apart is the participants' commitment, practicing tirelessly for a minimum of two months. It is almost impossible for the students to have hardly a month to practice and still make it to a phenomenal show.</p>
